# Bootstrap Transforms

Bootstrap Transforms are specific to the bootstrapping process, and likely not useful elsewhere 
as they are coded to do specific bootstrapping things.

For more info on [Transforms, see here][].

The Bootstrap Transforms expect to be in a pipeline whose piped payload is a BootstrapOption 
object, though they may also accept specific passed in payloads.

[Transforms, see here]:       TBD
